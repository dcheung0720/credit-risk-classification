## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* The purpose of this analysis is to predict whether a loan is high or low risk based on factors like loan size, interest rate, etc so we can ensure a stable economy.
* The financial information in this dataset are loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, derogatory marks, number of accounts,and total debt to predict whether a loan is risky or not.
* We are prediciting "loan status" where 0 represents low risk and 1 represents high risk
* I first analyzed the data for any anomolies and created a training and testing data sets. We trained the model with the training data set and tested with the testing data, which is agnostic tot he training data so it can be represent the model's performance as good as possible.
* In this analysis, we used logistic regression to predict whether a loan is risky. Logistic regression is commonly used for binary classifcation as it can provide us with a probability.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
